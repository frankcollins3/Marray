# Marray
{Marriage: reductiveFunc(possibilities[i].conditions.return[i]}

Not exactly starting the app but bookmarking an idle thought's rough draft on some UI that would facilitate:

Promise() based app about marriage and Promises

App sets probability that certain Promises have certain percentages of success.
Promise runs the probability function and resolves or rejects:

Probability of promises going well or not includes streaks/patterns/intertia/personality:
Good Promises going bad or just Bad Promises being the only Promises() can start the effect of bad promises chaining
Things going well at the start and staying can be likely to be even more sturdy, just as the above example is as oppositely darning. 

// as I realize this it seems a lot of the world of relationships are async functions and things of time-based expectations.

probably be a simple 1 page UI in next.js|typescript|prisma|postgres|graphql|redux and friends 

if this app doesn't happen its just the entering thinking of ideas or ideas entering thinking

// As I commit the funny thing is the whole Marray[i, i, i] the index being everyone saying [i || I || Me ] for Marray/Marry
